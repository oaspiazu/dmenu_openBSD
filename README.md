# dmenu_openBSD

This is dmenu with 2 patches. This version is prepared for OpenBSD (just change the relevant line in config.mk for other systems)

Patches:
line-height: https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/line-height/ \
alpha: https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/ \

The second patch is not for dmenu but for DWM. I adapted the patch to dmenu so I could have alpha.
