# dmenu_openBSD

This is dmenu with some patches. This version is prepared for OpenBSD (just change the relevant line in config.mk for other systems)

border: https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/border/ \
xyz: https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xyw/ \
alpha: https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/ 

The last patch is not for dmenu but for DWM. I adapted the patch to dmenu so I could have alpha on dmenu.
